# Shadow_Launcher
### A lite, user controlled, easy-to-use launcher for everything you access each and every day.

This was a personal project, scripted in AHK, up until SloopyMeat agreed to help turn it into a "proper app others could use".

So, here it is.

Use it :-)

...well, not really. It still uses hardcoded values for my personal use, so you'll either have to tweak it yourself, or wait for our next updates.

I'd suggest a bit of waiting. It sucks as it is.
