# Shadow_Launcher
### A lite, user controlled, easy-to-use launcher for everything you access each and every day.

This was a personal project, scripted in AHK, up until SloopyMeat agreed to help turn it into a "proper app others could use".

Although the AHK files you see here were created for personal use, and hence contain hardcoded values, feel free to tweak them for your own use until Shadow Launcher turns into a proper program anyone could actually use.


### Latest progress:
The basic front-end is almost finished. Now it's time to turn my attention to the settings screens.



### Shadow Launcher uses bits and bytes from:
